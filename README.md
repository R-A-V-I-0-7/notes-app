   - It may take a few minutes for changes to appear after pushing

### Important Notes for Deployment

- Since GitHub Pages is a static hosting service, the Supabase backend functionality will only work if you've properly configured your Supabase project with the correct CORS settings.
- In your Supabase project dashboard, go to Settings > API > CORS and add your GitHub Pages URL to the allowed origins.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Sign up for a free account at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Once the project is created, note your project URL and anon key (found in Project Settings > API)

### 2. Set Up the Database

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to the SQL Editor
2. Create the `notes` table with the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE notes (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  color TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT current_timestamp NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT current_timestamp NOT NULL
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE notes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy to allow users to only access their own notes
CREATE POLICY "Users can access own notes" ON notes
FOR ALL TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Add a function to update the updated_at timestamp
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = current_timestamp;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Create a trigger that calls update_updated_at_column() when a row is updated
CREATE TRIGGER update_notes_updated_at
BEFORE UPDATE ON notes
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

-- Enable realtime for the notes table
BEGIN;
  DROP PUBLICATION IF EXISTS supabase_realtime;
  CREATE PUBLICATION supabase_realtime;
COMMIT;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE notes;
```

### 3. Configure Your App

1. Open `script.js` and replace the Supabase configuration with your project details:

```javascript
const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://your-project-url.supabase.co';
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'your-anon-key';
```

### 4. Run the App

The app is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so you can:

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser, or
2. Use a local development server:
   - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Install a simple server: `npm install -g http-server`
   - Navigate to the project folder and run: `http-server`
   - Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
